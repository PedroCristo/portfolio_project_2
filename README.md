## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an online quiz that is visually appealing from the userâ€™s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game.
2. Build an easy to navigate quiz and game for its users to play.
3. Build a quiz that is both enjoyable and challenging for the user. 
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to understand the main purpose of the game.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play.
3. Be able to see my results after playing the game.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to find new quizzes when they are available.
2. Be able to check the Height Scores page
3. Be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
   
## Design

### Wireframe
In this project I decided to build a prototype using the tool Canva before starting work on the code. It was helpful from an UX perspective as I could display the different elements in the screen and work with them with the objective of building an application that would be easily used by the users.<br>

### Website Structure

#### Pages:

* Quiz 1 - Sports
* Quiz 2 - History
* Quiz 3 - Geography
* Game End

#### Colour Scheme
 ![Color Scheme](./assets/images/readme/color-pallete.png)<br>
 The main colour scheme I chose for this project is an overall blue tone and purple with a darker colour for maximum user accessibility. I have choosen a green color as an interactive-color to contrast with the background.

 #### Typography
* The Roboto, sans-serif is used as the main font for the whole website.
      
#### Imagery
* 3 images were used as a background for the website pages.
* 1 image was used for the Favicon.
  
### Interactive Links  
* At the bottom of the Home page, users can access the game's social media links (Facebook and Instagram). Once these icons are clicked they open a new tab.
