## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an online quiz that is visually appealing from the userâ€™s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game.
2. Build an easy to navigate quiz and game for its users to play.
3. Build a quiz that is both enjoyable and challenging for the user. 
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to understand the main purpose of the game.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play.
3. Be able to see my results after playing the game.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to find new quizzes when they are available.
2. Be able to check the Height Scores page
3. Be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
   
## Design

### Wireframe
In this project I decided to build a prototype using the tool Canva before starting work on the code. It was helpful from an UX perspective as I could display the different elements in the screen and work with them with the objective of building an application that would be easily used by the users.<br>

* The player has 3 different quizzes in the game. For each quiz the user will see the question on the top center [2] and 4 choices [3] are available.
The player then has to choose one of the choices and if the answer is right will win 25 points. The score will be displayed on the bottom right[5]. 
While the game is going on, users can see the progress bar updating any time they answer a question [1] and the question counter will also update on the bottom left [4] .
On the top right the users can check at any time what quiz they are on [6].

#### Right Answer
![Right Answer](./assets/images/readme/quiz-land-right-answer.png)

#### Wrong Answer
![Wrong Answer](./assets/images/readme/quiz-land-wrong-answer.png)
